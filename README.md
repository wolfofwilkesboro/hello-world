My learning repository for Github. 
Hello, my name is Joshua. I am 38 years old and live in the western mountains of North Carolina. I have been an avid user of all things Apple since October of 2014. I began this rabbit hole with the purchase of an iPhone 3G. Next was an ipad followed by my mid 2014 MacBook Pro. It was long after my laptop purchase that I started to discover the beauty of computers and thier power to make life much easier. From keeping up with my taxes (I am self employed) and scheduling clients to photo and video editing right up to task managment. I have since become very much into automation and producitivy. I love webinars on vaious topics also. I have discovered slowly the power these machines hold. And I also have found out first hand that they can become over used. I am very excited to expand my horizons and skillset by becoming an member of this community.
